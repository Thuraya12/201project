### Reflections and Comments
creating This website wasn't hard to make and it was a good way to practice mixing html, css, and js to make a good webpage.
I think we are progressing step by step in a proper way and gradually towards more advanced things.
It took me more than 3 hours to finish, I expected to finish earlier but I think it was because of the so many requirements that we must be careful to not miss any of them.

I think the courses way of teaching allows me to know more by every class about the nature of this industry and find answers for things we wasn't noticing or don't know their nature and how the web works, and let me sit plans in my head for coming phases.

 Measuring the coding skill that I'm mastering in html, css, and js beacouse it is dependent on how much I code and practice, trying things out, planning and achieving a task is the best for learning process of programming.

Evaluating what we've learned couple times a week or more is very good to make us revise the amount of knowledge and skills that we grasped and know where we were and where we are now.
